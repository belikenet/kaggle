This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **R Tools | Publish | Preview** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

```{r kable}
library(readr)
library(knitr)
makeActiveBinding('.', function() .Last.value, env = .GlobalEnv)

#train <- read_csv(file = "../../titanic/train.csv")
#kable(train)
names(knit_global())
seq(1,10)
.Last.value
```

Testing last value `r eval(.Last.value, enclos=knit_global())`
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
